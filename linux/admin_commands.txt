#free 	
	command shows free, total and swap memory information in bytes.

#df
	report file system disk space usage

#lscpu 
	display information on CPU architecture

#lsblk

#du     estimate file space usage
	-s, --summarize

#uname 
	uname -a
	Linux mymachine 2.6.18-194.e15PAE #1 SMP Fri Apr 2 15:37:44 EDT 2010 i686 i686 i386 GNU/Linux	
	    "Linux": The machine's kernel name (e.g, OS).
	    "mymachine": The machine's node name (e.g, hostname).
	    "2.6.18-194.e15PAE": The kernel version
	    "#1 SMP Fri Apr 2 15:37:44 EDT 2010": The kernel version and build time.
	    "i686 i686": The processor type and hardware platform.
	    "i386": The architecture of the processor. (This and the two above basically all mean the same thing on most systems. 
		    They typically only differ on certain embedded platforms.)
	    "GNU/Linux": The operating system name.


#service
	Service command call script located at /etc/init.d/ directory and execute the script. 
	There are two ways to start the any service. For example we start the service called httpd with service command.
	service httpd start
	/etc/init.d/httpd start

#uptime
	In Linux uptime command shows since how long your system is running and the number of users are currently logged in 
	and also displays load average for 1,5 and 15 minutes intervals
	uptime
	 13:47:41 up 1 day, 18:12,  3 users,  load average: 3.31, 3.17, 3.305

#users 
	Users command displays currently logged in users.	

#top
	display Linux processes
	top -n 1 -b > top-output.txt
	n => no of iterations or refresh
	b => batch mode
	interactive mode:
	k => to kill a process
	c => shows absolute path of process
	By default, top displays %CPU as a percentage of a single CPU. 
	shif + i => to show overall percentage.
	
#ps
	report a snapshot of the current processes.
	
	output:
	    USER = user owning the process
	    PID = process ID of the process
	    PPID = ID number of the process's parent process
	    %CPU = It is the CPU time used divided by the time the process has been running.
	    %MEM = ratio of the processâ€™s resident set size to the physical memory on the machine
	    VSZ = virtual memory usage of entire process (in KiB)
	    RSS = resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (in KiB)
	    TTY = controlling tty (terminal)
	    STAT = multi-character process state
	    START = starting time or date of the process
	    TIME = cumulative CPU time
	    COMMAND = command with all its arguments
	    ADDR    =  Memory address of the process
	    C or CP =  CPU usage and scheduling information
	    NI      =  nice value
	    F       =  Flags
	    PRI     =  Priority of the process
	    RSS     =  Real memory usage
	    SZ      =  Virtual memory usage
	    WCHAN   =  Memory address of the event the process is waiting for
	
	    R running or runnable (on run queue)
	    D uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
	    S interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
	    Z defunct/zombie, terminated but not reaped by its parent
	    T stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced


####################  creating bootable usb ################################################

1: Check the pen drive device name.
	lsblk

2: Unmount and Format the pendrive.
	sudo umount /dev/sdc1
	sudo mkfs.vfat -n 'Ubuntu' -I /dev/sdc1

3:Burn it bootable using th iso file.
	sudo dd bs=4M if=/home/bbnladmin/Desktop/ISO /ubuntu-12.04.iso of=/dev/sdb1 && sync
