/*The default constructor is auto-generated if there is no user-declared constructor (12.1/5).
  The copy constructor is auto-generated if there is no user-declared move constructor or move assignment operator 
      (because there are no move constructors or move assignment operators in C++03, this simplifies to "always" in C++03) (12.8/8).
  The copy assignment operator is auto-generated if there is no user-declared move constructor or move assignment operator (12.8/19).
  The destructor is auto-generated if there is no user-declared destructor (12.4/4).
 C++11 and later only:
  The move constructor is auto-generated if there is no user-declared copy constructor, copy assignment operator or destructor, and if the generated move constructor is valid (12.8/10).
  The move assignment operator is auto-generated if there is no user-declared copy constructor, copy assignment operator or destructor, and if the generated move assignment operator is valid (e.g. if it wouldn't need to assign constant members) (12.8/21).
