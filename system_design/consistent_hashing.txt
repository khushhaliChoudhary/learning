Consistent hashing is a special kind of hashing such that when a hash table is
resized and consistent hashing is used,
only K/n keys need to be remapped on average, where K is the number of keys,
and n is the number of slots.
  Solves following problems:
  -Redistribution of all keys every time we scale up or down[horizontal
scalability].
    creating the hash key space
    Representing the hash key space as a Ring.
    Placing servers on the hash ring.
    Determining placements of keys on Servers
    Adding a server to the Ring.
    Removing a server from the Ring.
    
  -Non uniform distribution of data across servers[data hotspots].
    To assign not one but many labels to each server on the hash ring.
