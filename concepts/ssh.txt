symmetrical encryption : shared secret key
  eg. AES(advanced encryption standard, blowfish, 3DES
  Diffie Hellman algorithm is used to arrive at the common key.
asymmetrical encrytion : public and private key pair
hashing : message integrity, algo is irreversible
  eg. HMAC(hash based message authentication code)


(Encrypted message + MAC) are being exchanged to provide encryption and integrity.

Steps followed in ssh:
*client opens TCP connection, agrees upon a protocol version with server
   and authenticate the server using the the public key of the server.
*client and server negotiate a common secret key for the session using 
  diffi hellman algorithm. After this, every communication is wrapped with this
  symmetric session key.
*User authentication is done next.client sends the id of the key pair it wants 
  to authenticate with to the server.
*server checks the authorized_keys of the account that the key is attempting to log
  into with the key ID.
*Asymmetric authentication along with MD5 is used to authenticate the user.

SSH Tunneling

local Port Forwarding : Make remore resoure accessible on local system
  use to map local port to a remote end point through a ssh server.
  ssh -L local_port:remote_address:remote_port username@server.com

remote Port Forwarding: Make local resource accesible on a  remote machine
  ssh -R remote_port:local_address:local_port username@server.com

dynamic port Forwarding: Use ssh server as a proxy.
  ssh -D local_port username@server.com
  You could then configure an application to access the SOCKS proxy on your local PC
